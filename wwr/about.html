            <h2>History</h2>
            <p> "A Journey Through Time"
                In the summer of 1995, adventure enthusiast Carlos Rivera found himself captivated by the untamed beauty
                and roaring rapids of Oaxaca's rivers. Inspired by the thrill of whitewater rafting and the majestic
                landscapes, Carlos decided to transform his passion into a business. Thus, Wild Rapids Tours was born.
                Starting with just a couple of rafts and a small team of dedicated guides, Carlos embarked on his
                mission to share the exhilarating experience of whitewater rafting with others. Word quickly spread
                about the unforgettable adventures offered by Wild Rapids Tours, and the company grew rapidly, becoming
                a favorite among locals and tourists alike.</p>
