            <p> Hello! My name is Enoc Reyes, I am living in Oaxaca Mexico, I enjoy to play tenis and spend time with my family to have fun. Currently I study programming in BYU-I. I‚Äôve enjoyed reading about different types of engineering and how they‚Äôre applied to different types of problems. I think it‚Äôs essential to have a wide range of knowledge when working in an engineering field to be prepared for anything.

                I‚Äôm looking forward to meeting many new people while study.The last few years I have been working in interior design and hosting tours in the city where I live, I have met people from different countries and I have had the opportunity to practice my English a little. I have a beautiful family that I love and that loves me, we are very close and we try to help each other as much as possible. In the next few years I would like to travel to the European continent to visit at least 2 of the most important cities.</p>

            <p>Mexico is a constitutional republic comprising 31 states and Mexico City, its capital and largest city. It is a major oil exporter, but rural areas and shanty towns suffer neglect. Mexico was the site of several advanced Amerindian civilizations until Spain conquered and colonized the area in the early 16th century1234. The official language is Spanish, and the currency is the Peso.</p>
